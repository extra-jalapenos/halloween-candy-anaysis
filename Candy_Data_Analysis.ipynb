That was the question this dataset was collected to answer. Data was collected by creating a website where participants were shown [presenting two fun-sized candies and asked to click on the one they would prefer to receive](https://walthickey.com/2017/10/18/whats-the-best-halloween-candy/).\n","\n","In total, more than `269,000` votes were collected from 8,371 different IP addresses.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## **Dataset**\n","\n","This dataset was curated by the prominent statistics group FiveThirtyEight and housed on Kaggle at this link: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fivethirtyeight/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking\">The Ultimate Halloween Candy Power Ranking</a>\n","\n","Content **candy-data.csv** includes attributes for each candy along with its ranking. For binary variables, `1` means `yes`, `0` means `no`. The data contains the following fields:\n","\n","- **`Chocolate`**: Does it contain Chocolate?\n","- **`fruity`**: Is it fruit flavored?\n","- **`caramel`**: Is there caramel in the candy?\n","- **`peanutalmondy`**: Does it contain peanuts, peanut butter or almonds?\n","- **`nougat`**: Does it contain nougat?\n","- **`crispedricewafer`**: Does it contain crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component?\n","- **`hard`**: Is it a hard candy?\n","- **`bar`**: Is it a candy bar?\n","- **`pluribus`**: Is it one of many candies in a bag or box?\n","- **`sugarpercent`**: The percentile of sugar it falls under within the data set. This value indicates the sweetness of a candy compared to all other candies in the dataset. For example, if a candy has a `sugarpercent of 80`, it means it is sweeter than `80%` of the candies in the dataset.\n","- **`pricepercent`**: The unit price percentile compared to the rest of the set. (same concept as sugarpercent)\n","- **`winpercent`**: The overall win percentage according to `269,000` matchups.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## **Objective**\n","\n","The objective is to identify which product characteristics drive customer sentiment towards candies in general. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to determine the factors that contribute to a candy's popularity (winpercent) and make a data-driven recommendation for a new candy product that maximizes positive customer sentiment.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","## **Sample Sugar Percent Calculation**\n","\n","Suppose we have 5 candies with the following sugar contents:\n","\n","- Candy A: 15 grams\n","- Candy B: 20 grams\n","- Candy C: 10 grams\n","- Candy D: 25 grams\n","- Candy E: 5 grams\n","\n","To calculate the `sugarpercent` for each candy, follow these steps:\n","\n","1. **List the sugar contents in ascending order**:\n","\n","   $$\n","   \\text{E: 5 grams} < \\text{C: 10 grams} < \\text{A: 15 grams} < \\text{B: 20 grams} < \\text{D: 25 grams}\n","   $$\n","\n","2. **Determine the rank of each candy**:\n","   - Candy E (5 grams): Rank 1\n","   - Candy C (10 grams): Rank 2\n","   - Candy A (15 grams): Rank 3\n","   - Candy B (20 grams): Rank 4\n","   - Candy D (25 grams): Rank 5\n","\n","3. **Calculate the percentile for each candy** using the formula:\n","\n","   $$\n","   \\text{Percentile} = \\frac{\\text{Rank} - 1}{\\text{Total number of candies} - 1} \\times 100\n","   $$\n","\n","Let's calculate the percentiles:\n","\n","- **Candy E**:\n","\n","   $$\n","   \\frac{1 - 1}{5 - 1} \\times 100 = \\frac{0}{4} \\times 100 = 0\\%\n","   $$\n","\n","- **Candy C**:\n","\n","   $$\n","   \\frac{2 - 1}{5 - 1} \\times 100 = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25\\%\n","   $$\n","\n","- **Candy A**:\n","\n","   $$\n","   \\frac{3 - 1}{5 - 1} \\times 100 = \\frac{2}{4} \\times 100 = 50\\%\n","   $$\n","\n","- **Candy B**:\n","\n","   $$\n","   \\frac{4 - 1}{5 - 1} \\times 100 = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 100 = 75\\%\n","   $$\n","\n","- **Candy D**:\n","\n","   $$\n","   \\frac{5 - 1}{5 - 1} \\times 100 = \\frac{4}{4} \\times 100 = 100\\%\n","   $$\n","\n","So, the sugarpercent values for the candies are:\n","\n","- Candy E: 0%\n","- Candy C: 25%\n","- Candy A: 50%\n","- Candy B: 75%\n","- Candy D: 100%"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CdKEpI0Pks15"},"source":["<br>\n","\n","****\n","## **Read the Data and Perform basic
